Benchmark Runner

This is the main entry point for the benchmarking application. It reads the YAML configuration
file and orchestrates the entire benchmarking process by:
- Loading and validating benchmark configurations
- Executing benchmark scenarios
- Collecting and processing results
- Generating reports

Usage:
    python benchmark_runner.py [config.yaml]

The YAML file should contain all necessary configuration parameters for the benchmarks.
